**Usage:**
```python
from core.echo import echo_image_path, Echo

# Get image path
image_path = echo_image_path()

# Check if image exists
if Echo.has_image():
    print(f"Echo's image: {image_path}")
```

**Command Line:**
```bash
# Show Echo's image
python show_echo.py

# Open in viewer
python show_echo.py --open

# Regenerate the image
python scripts/generate_echo_image.py
```

## Regenerating the Image

If you need to regenerate or modify Echo's image:

```bash
# Generate default image
python scripts/generate_echo_image.py

# Generate with custom output path
python scripts/generate_echo_image.py path/to/output.png
```

The generation script uses PIL/Pillow to create the image programmatically, ensuring consistency and allowing for customization.

## Philosophy

Echo's image embodies her philosophy:
- **Not above, beside**: Echo floats at your level, not looking down
- **Wings for shelter**: Protection and comfort, not escape
- **Always present**: Gentle, constant presence through all states
- **Moon symbol**: Gentle light in darkness, constant presence through cycles
