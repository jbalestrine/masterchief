# Changelog

All notable changes to the MasterChief Enterprise DevOps Platform will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [2.2.6] - 2026-05-30

### Added
- GitHub Actions workflow directory restored (`ci.yml`, `chocolatey.yml`, `ansible-validation.yml`, `dsc-validation.yml`, `module-loader-tests.yml`, `terraform-validation.yml`).
- New `pypi-publish.yml` workflow: publishes to PyPI automatically on GitHub release or version tag push using OIDC trusted publishing.
- `ai` extras group in `setup.py` for optional local GGUF/ML dependencies.
- `all` extras group flattened to an explicit list to avoid self-referential packaging issues.

### Changed
- `requirements-optional.txt`: `llama-cpp-python` install now gated to `python_version < "3.14"` to prevent broken wheel installs on Python 3.14.
- `requirements.txt`: full-platform install command added to header comments.
- `setup.py` docstring version updated to 2.2.6 / May 2026.
- `echo/runtime/model_runtime.py`: rebuilt as plain module-level functions; eliminates `TypeError: 'classmethod' object is not callable` at startup.
- `main.py`: missing `llama_cpp` on startup now logs a warning instead of a traceback. Fixed two embedded-JS regex escape sequences that triggered Python `SyntaxWarning`.

### Fixed
- `data/echo_training/learned_patterns.json`: cleared git conflict markers and rewritten as valid UTF-8 JSON to stop parse errors at startup.
- `README.md`: replaced duplicated/concatenated historical content with a single current source of truth.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Training orchestration and UI (versioned release 1.2.1)
  - `/echo-train` web UI to start, monitor, and cancel training jobs.
  - Server-side training orchestration with stub and PEFT engine selection.
  - `tools/peft_train.py` minimal PEFT/LoRA training wrapper (template).
  - `tools/dataset_helpers.py` to convert resources into JSONL training examples.
  - `/api/resources/convert_to_training` to generate training files from resources.
  - Persistent training job metadata stored in `data/models_output/train_jobs.json`.
  - Background cleanup/archiving for old training artifacts.

### Changed
- Upload/resource handling
  - Server-side validation for resource uploads (allowed types, size limits, safe filenames).
  - Resources index improvements and UI preview fixes.

### Fixed
- Several resource endpoint NameError issues and improved error handling for resource preview.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-02-06

### Added
- Training orchestration (stub) and UI.
- Dataset helpers for JSONL conversion.
- Secure upload validation for resources.

### Notes
- The PEFT/LoRA training wrapper is a template; for efficient fine-tuning, GPU and additional dependencies are recommended. The default `stub` engine is suitable for CPU-only testing.
